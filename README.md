OpenPhone is an AI-native Android OS that turns the phone into an agentic
device: a system-level AI agent that can see the screen, operate apps, remember
commitments, monitor phone events, and continue work in the background with
user review and auditability built into the OS.

This repository is the canonical OpenPhone entry point. It contains the
OpenPhone-owned Android overlay, privileged assistant app, framework patches,
model/tool policy configuration, build scripts, device notes, contracts, and
release tooling. It intentionally does not vendor the full Android source tree.

## AI-Native Phone Runtime

OpenPhone is built around a system-level agent, not a chatbot app. The agent is
installed as a privileged OS component with an always-available system surface
for conversation, realtime voice, approvals, active runs, and proactive state.
Actions are mediated through OpenPhone framework services instead of brittle
app-layer automation.

The agent can read structured phone context and use model-visible tools to work
across apps. Context includes the foreground app, visible UI hierarchy, screen
text and controls, notifications, calls, messages, calendar state, location,
battery, connectivity, active watchers, background runs, and commitments the
user made in conversation. Sensitive actions are reviewable, and behavior can
be inspected through audit logs, trajectories, screenshots, policy decisions,
and release validators.

OpenPhone is also built for proactive work. Heartbeats quietly check whether
anything needs attention. Scheduled jobs run exact workflows. Watchers monitor
phone context such as missed calls, messages, notifications, foreground app
state, visible screen state, calendar changes, location, battery, connectivity,
and commitments the user made in conversation. Background runs keep working
after the current chat turn, while the system surface shows what is running, why
it started, what it last said, and what needs review.

The current developer preview is based on LineageOS 23.2 / Android 16 and
targets Google Pixel 9a (`tegu`) first.

## Local Bonsai: Interactive by Default

The planned `BonsaiRuntime` is designed for private, on-device interaction.
It is a privileged Binder service with read-only mmap model assets, not a
writable-storage executable or a network server. The assistant receives UI
input immediately, streams output as soon as the runtime produces it, and can
cancel an active generation without waiting for the model to finish.

The interactive profile favors perceived speed and predictable latency:

- one active generation keeps CPU/GPU, memory bandwidth, and thermal headroom
  focused on the foreground conversation;
- a 2K default context and 512-token reasoning budget cap expensive prefill and
  hidden reasoning by default;
- prompt-cache reuse and a thermal-gated post-unlock prewarm reduce warm-turn
  startup work without draining the device in the background;
- image input defaults to 1024 vision tokens; full-detail OCR is an explicit,
  slower user request;
- cancellation must be acknowledged within 250 ms; the runtime targets a warm
  first token at p50 under 2 s and p95 under 4 s, with p50 decode at least 8
  tokens/s on the accepted device profile.

Those are release targets, not unmeasured promises. A device build cannot be
called interactive until it records the benchmark evidence in
[docs/BONSAI_LATENCY.md](docs/BONSAI_LATENCY.md). The 8B Q2_0 model is the
default bring-up model; 27B is opt-in only after it meets the same thermal,
memory, and latency gates.

## Use Cases

- "Catch me up on everything important from overnight" - consume missed calls,
  messages, notifications, calendar changes, and reminders, then return a short
  morning gist.
- "Order me an Uber to the office" - open the right app, set the destination,
  select a ride, and stop for review before booking.
- "Play something random on Spotify" - open Spotify, choose music, and continue
  until playback actually starts.
- "If I miss a call from this number, send them 'I'll call you back soon'" -
  create a watcher tied to future call context and message policy.
- "Watch for delivery updates and only bother me if something changes" - turn
  notification noise into a targeted background monitor.
- "Help me finish this screen" - inspect the visible app state, identify the
  next control, and act through OS-mediated taps or text input.
- "Remind me when this conversation becomes relevant" - turn a commitment into
  durable state that can resurface later based on time, app, or phone context.
- "Keep working on this after I leave" - continue a multi-step task as a
  visible background run with approval where needed.

## Quick Start

Validate the repository:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh
git diff --check
```

The first runnable OS test path is the OpenPhone SDK phone emulator. Build an
emulator system image on a Linux Android build host, install it into a local
Android SDK/AVD, and verify the OpenPhone framework services before moving to
Pixel 9a hardware evals:

```bash
./scripts/sync.sh
./scripts/apply-patches.sh
./scripts/build-emulator.sh --arch arm64     # Apple Silicon UI target
# or: ./scripts/build-emulator.sh --arch x86_64
```

The portable artifact is
`$OPENPHONE_ANDROID_DIR/out/target/product/<emu64a|emu64x>/sdk-repo-linux-system-images.zip`.
The local install, AVD creation, UI launch, CLI/MCP smoke, and OpenClaw runtime
smoke are documented in [docs/EMULATOR.md](docs/EMULATOR.md).

Install `repo` if needed:

```bash
./scripts/install-repo.sh
```

Sync and patch the Android tree:

```bash
./scripts/sync.sh
./scripts/apply-patches.sh
```

Build the generic OpenPhone ARM64 product for validation:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh openphone_arm64
```

Build the Pixel 9a target on a Linux Android build host:

```bash
OPENPHONE_BUILD_GOAL="droid target-files-package otapackage" \
  ./scripts/build.sh openphone_tegu
```

For assistant-only iteration on an already flashed development device:

```bash
OPENPHONE_BUILD_GOAL=OpenPhoneAssistant ./scripts/build.sh openphone_tegu
scripts/push-assistant-apk.sh /path/to/OpenPhoneAssistant.apk
```

Full build instructions are in [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md). Testing and
emulator/physical eval guidance is in [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

## Device Support

OpenPhone builds on LineageOS device infrastructure, so the broader universe of
potential ports starts with the official LineageOS supported-device list:
[wiki.lineageos.org/devices](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/). OpenPhone
support is narrower: a device is only supported after it has an OpenPhone
product target, flash/recovery notes, hardware validation, agent validation, and
release coverage.

The first OpenPhone physical target is Google Pixel 9a (`tegu`). Generic ARM64
builds are useful for product graph validation, but they are not a supported
phone target.

OpenPhone does not redistribute Google apps, Google Mobile Services, vendor
blobs, signing keys, private firmware, or restricted device material. Local
developer GMS sideload notes are in [docs/GMS.md](docs/GMS.md).

See [docs/devices/MATRIX.md](docs/devices/MATRIX.md) and
[docs/devices/tegu.md](docs/devices/tegu.md).

The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 is tracked as a guarded candidate, not a supported
target. Its preflight and stop conditions are in [docs/devices/flip7.md](docs/devices/flip7.md).
